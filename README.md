# Green 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/DavidBakerEffendi/green.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/DavidBakerEffendi/green)

## Notes
SATCanonizer and ConstantPropagation are functional. Test cases for 
ConstantPropagation have been slightly adjusted to accommodate the order 
through which the Expressions are output, but the correct variables and 
their calculated constants will come out in correct order otherwise.

## To my dear peers...
Go away and figure Green out for yourselves! It's EZPZ.
