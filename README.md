## Notes
SATCanonizer and ConstantPropagation are functional. Test cases for 
ConstantPropagation have been slightly adjusted to accommodate the order 
through which the Expressions are returned when serialized (e.g. changing 
the order of parenthesis), but the correct variables and their calculated 
constants will come out in correct order otherwise.
